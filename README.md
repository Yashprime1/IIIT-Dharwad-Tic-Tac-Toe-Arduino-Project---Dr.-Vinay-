--Introduction :
The famous Tic-Tac-Toe is brought to action through the amazing lcd display(20*4) and Arduino using push buttons to control it.

--List of Components :
1. Arduino UNO
2. LCD Display (20*4)
3. 4 Push Buttons , Breadboard , Wires.

--Technical Details :
This project consisted of 4 push buttons which converted the digital signals on the board to the positions on LCD. (i.e. take an example like if it’s 0011 then this gets converted to position 3 on 3*3 matrix) .Now, firstly there will be selection by user 1 if he/she wants x/o has his/her character to take on the arena then there’ll be just options for each users turn-by-turn to select the positions they would like to put by clicking on the push buttons for the designated positions and connections were made from Arduino board to the LCD Display as per standard connections mentioned in the LCD configuration.

--Performance Report :
This project works successfully without any bugs.
